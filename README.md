# Chienomi AP Extension

## Synopsis

This extension adds ActivityPub integration to Chienomi, allowing users to follow and get notified of new posts.

## Description

Chienomi is static website generated by PureBuilder Simply.

Since PureBuilder Simply outputs static files without dynamic capabilities, it's not natively compatible with the ActivityPub protocol.

This project hacks ActivityPub support into Chienomi using a web app, workers, and CLI tools.

This extension isn't highly versatile, but it may give you some ideas for adding ActivityPub support to your own PureBuilder Simply project.
